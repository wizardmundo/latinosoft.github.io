The business is tailored to support IT Services and help to transition companies to the CLOUD. From 1995 to 1999, Studies in Sociology. In April 2001, while I worked in several Industry related companies as a junior “Admin” as well as providing different levels of  IT ‘tier Support’ I felt that it was time to act and no longer fund these organizations with what I consider a talent and a passion to help individuals to succeed with technology. As a result, I decided to operate my own business independently as a part-time in the beginning. I have helped thousands of Individual and Small Business owners with their computers and network nightmares but also leveraging some of my former education in sociology and psychology into advising them in the business aspect of having a company. Technology is this much! A little bit of each Industry and profession. The business has operated in this manner ever since there was a need for education and willingness to learn I have provided affordable Technology and Trusted Advisor services to Small Business Owners.~~\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Support Contact\r\nPlease feel free to reach me or if you would like to obtain a test-drive of Upcoming technologies and Services before making a decision. service@latinosoft.ca\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Special Thanks to GitHub founders\r\nChris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo)","google":"UA-55816656-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
